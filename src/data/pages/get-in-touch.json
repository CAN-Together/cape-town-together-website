The best way to get in touch is join a CAN and get involved in the network or to contact specific CANs directly. You can find these in the directory. \n\nSometimes we can help to point you to the right person CAN or person in the network or help share a message to everyone. Please email [capetowntogethercan@gmail.com](mailto:capetowntogethercan@gmail.com). While volunteers try to check this email regularly please be patient."
