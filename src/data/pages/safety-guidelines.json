The virus has been spreading around the world since November 2019. Although other types of coronavirus existed before, this coronavirus is very contagious, and has already spread to many countries around the world. Because it is spreading so fast, it is called a pandemic. It is very important to call the hotline if you develop any of the symptoms listed below.\n\n## What are the symptoms of Covid-19?\n\nMost people (8 out of 10) who get COVID-19 only get a mild illness that feels like having the flu, some don’t even notice that they are sick. The symptoms include:\n\n* Cough\n* Fever\n* Sore throat\n* Shortness of breath\n\nThe symptoms usually go away on their own. However, people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.\n\nOther symptoms can include:\n\n* Tiredness\n* Aches and pains\n\nVery few people also experience diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.\n\n## Who is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19?\n\nAbout 2 out of 10 people who get COVID-19 will get very sick. People who are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 are:\n\n* People older than 60 years\n* People with other chronic illnesses (comorbidities). These include:\n* * Chronic cardiovascular disease\n  * Chronic respiratory disease\n  * Diabetes\n  * Cancer\n  * At the moment, there is no evidence or official guidance on the impact of COVID-19 on people with HIV or TB.\n\nCOVID-19 can be fatal. The chance of someone dying from COVID-19 depends on whether they are able to get the health care that they need. If too many people get sick from COVID-19 at the same time, the hospitals and clinics will be overwhelmed, and many people will not be able to get the treatment they need. That is why it is very important that everybody works hard to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\n## What is the treatment for Covid-19\n\nThere is currently no antiviral treatment for COVID-19. For mild illness, the recommended treatment is supportive so rest, drink lots of water, and maybe take some paracetamol. The same as for flu. But, an important difference is that if you have COVID-19 it is very important to self-isolate so that you don’t spread the virus to anyone else. However, some people who get very sick with COVID-19 will need to be treated in hospital. Make sure you call the hotline if your condition deteriorates.\n\n## How does COVID-19 spread?\n\nCoronavirus can enter the body through the eyes, nose, and mouth. There are two ways the coronavirus can be spread:\n\n* Respiratory droplets: When someone with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or blows their nose, tiny droplets are released into the air. These droplets can contain coronavirus. If someone else breaths in one of these tiny droplets, they can become infected\n* Fomites: Coronavirus can also be on surfaces that people touch often. This can happen if someone coughs or sneezes and the droplets land on that surface, or it can happen when someone with the virus touches that surface. If an uninfected person touches that same surface, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected.\n\n## Caring for COVID+ at home\n\nThe most important thing to do is to stay calm and remember that a person who is sick with COVID-19 will need care, comfort, compassion and support. You can care for a person who is sick with COVID-19 while also keeping yourself and others safe.\n\nYou should also make sure the affected person drinks plenty of water and eats enough healthy food. You can also use any other cold or flu medications, like paracetamol, that make the person feel better.\n\nMost people with COVID-19 get better at home. Letting the affected person recover at home, is also the right thing to do, because it prevents the spread of coronavirus to others. However, you should also try to keep track of the affected person’s symptoms. This will help you to know if they are getting better or worse, and will help you decide if it is necessary to take the person to a doctor, clinic or hospital, or to call an ambulance.\n\nFor advice, you can:\n\n* Phone the COVID-19 National Hotline on 0800 029 999, or the Provincial Hotline on 021 928 4102, or\n* Use the Western Cape Department of Health online symptoms assessment tool:<https://www.westerncape.gov.za/department-of-health/sars-cov-2-risk-assessment-form>. The symptom self assessment tool will help you decide what to do next and how to access a COVID-19 test, if necessary. At the moment only people who have travelled to a high risk country or have been in contact with a person with confirmed COVID19. This could change in the future as new tests become available. Keep checking:<https://www.westerncape.gov.za/dept/health>and of course the CTT page for updates on testing.\n* Remember to phone the hotline before deciding whether to take the affected person to a doctor, clinic, or hospital. If the person is very sick, then call an ambulance.\n* If the affected person needs medical help urgently, and you cannot get help with any of the above options, you might decide to try to take them to the health facility yourself. If you do this:\n* * Avoid using public transport, if possible, as this will put others at risk\n  * Put a mask on the affected person, and on yourself\n  * Wash your hands before you leave\n\n## Prevent the spread of COVID at home\n\nIf someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19, you will also need to make sure the virus does not spread to others in your home. Here are some tips:\n\n* If possible, the affected person should stay in a different room to others.\n* Only one person in the family should have responsibility for caring for the affected person. Other people in the household should try to avoid contact with the affected person.\n* Try not to touch the affected person, and keep at least 1.5 meters away where possible. If you need to touch the affected person to care for them or comfort them, be sure to wash your hands afterwards\n* Try not to share plates, cups, knives and forks with the sick person. If this is not possible, wash plates, cups, knives and forks the affected person has used thoroughly\n* Don’t share towels, sheets or blankets with the sick person. If you do, make sure you wash them often. Wash them thoroughly with hot water.\n* Clean high-touch surfaces in the house (such as door handles, cupboard handles, taps, counters) often (at least twice a day) with a diluted bleach solution, or other household cleaning products like handyandy.\n* The affected person and anybody interacting closely with them should wear a mask\n* Wash hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after interacting with the sick person",

      "title": "Safety Alert: Wearing a mask",
      "content": "The virus is transmitted in little drops of saliva when you cough and sneeze, and through viral particles that still live on surfaces (called fomites). You can protect people around you by wearing a mask when out in public.\n\nDo not use medical masks. We need to save these for frontline health workers. Healthcare workers are our country’s most valuable asset and we need to protect them. This means we need to make sure they can access medical masks. Because there is a global shortage of medical masks, as volunteers of the public, we should only use fabric masks (also called cloth masks). These are cheap and easy to make at home.\n\nAny cloth covering for your nose and mouth is better than nothing. However, if possible your mask should have three layers of fabric.\n\nIf you are NOT wearing a mask and you need to cough or sneeze, cough and sneeze into your elbow, or into a tissue if you have one. Throw the tissue away.\n\nMasks work because they stop droplets escaping from your mouth and nose when you cough, sneeze or even talk. These droplets contain coronavirus and can spread infection. For this reason, it is very important that people know how to use masks SAFELY. Otherwise, masks can also become a way for infection to spread. Here are some tips:\n\n* Only ever use a fresh, clean mask. Do not wear a mask that someone else has worn without washing it.\n* Wash your hands before touching your mask to put it on. Once it is on, don’t touch the fabric part of the mask (or any part of your face)\n* To take the mask off, hold it by the strings\n* After you remove your mask, put it straight into a container reserved for washing. Do not leave it around the house where it can spread the virus.\n* Wash your hands after removing the mask\n* Wash the mask after each time you use it. The mask should be washed in soap and water, preferably warm water (more than 60 degrees Celsius). Do not use bleach as this can irritate your lungs\n* Try to make sure you iron the mask after washing and drying. This is the best way to disinfect it.\n\nIf possible, your mask should be made of three layers of fabric. However, if you cannot get a triple-layer cloth mask, use any fabric and make sure it covers your nose and mouth.\n\nRemember that a mask does not offer complete protection from Covid-19 and you should use basic hygiene practices like handwashing, not touching your face, and staying 1.5 meters away from others, even if you are wearing a mask."

      "title": "Safety Alert: Hand Washing",
      "content": "The virus is killed by normal handsoap. Wash hands as often as possible with soap and water. Wash for 20 seconds at least. Ordinary hand soap is effective at killing the coronavirus if you wash for 20 seconds.\n\nIf you have hand sanitiser, take that with you when you are out. Sanitise your hands after you touch any high-touch surfaces.\n\nIf you don’t have hand sanitiser, and there is nowhere nearby to wash your hands, take a bottle of water and a small soap with you.\n\nThe virus infects you by entering your body through your eyes, nose or mouth. Don’t touch your face while you are out, and make sure you wash or sanitise your hands before touching your face. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth if you have not washed your hands"

      "title": "Safety Alert: Using public transport",
      "content": "Here are some tips for staying safe while using public transport:\n\n* Minimise the use of public transport. Try to only leave home for work, shopping and medical needs. Walk or cycle if possible.\n* Avoid peak (rush hour) travel times, if you can. Try not to take a bus or taxi that looks full.\n* If you are sick, or have any symptoms, rather stay home. This is to protect others using public transport.\n* Wash or sanitize your hands before you travel. If you have hand-sanitizer with you, sanitise your hands before and after getting on the bus or taxi. Don’t touch your face unless you have washed or sanitized your hands.\n* Avoid touching the rails or handles in the bus or taxi. These are high-touch surfaces and could spread COVID-19.\n* If you have to queue, make sure you stand 1.5 meters away from others.\n* Open the windows in the bus or taxi\n* Do not wear gloves. Gloves can spread the Coronavirus. Washing or sanitising your hands regularly is safter.\n* Wear a cloth mask at all times when using public transport and when out in public."

      "title": "Safety Alert: Social distancing",
      "content": "Social distancing means limiting your physical contact with others. Remember, that coronavirus can spread through the air if someone who has the virus coughs or sneezes. For this reason, you should stay 1.5 meters away from others at all times.\n\nDon’t hug, kiss or shake hands. When greeting someone, rather touch elbows or feet, instead.\n\nLarge gatherings like concerts, sports events and religious services are very dangerous because they could allow the virus to spread to lots of people at once. Encourage those in your community to cancel group events like religious services and sporting events.\n\n## Social distancing at home\n\nCOVID-19 can spread from one person to another within a household. Remember: infected people can spread the virus before they start to feel any symptoms. This means that someone could be infectious even though they are not sick.\n\nAlthough it is difficult, families and people living together should try to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in their homes, even if no one is sick. This means:\n\n* Encourage all members of the household to wash their hands as often as possible\n* Maintain good hygiene in the home. Wipe down high touch surfaces often (at least once a day) with household cleaning materials such as sunlight soap/HandyAndy. High touch surfaces are areas, surfaces or objects that are touched many times a day by more than one person in the household. This includes door handles, light switches, cupboard handles, taps. You can also use diluted bleach.\n* Limit hugging and kisses\n* Cough and sneeze into a tissue or into your elbow\n* If anyone is sick in the household, they should wear a mask in all shared areas, and if they might have COVID-19, then you should call the hotline."
